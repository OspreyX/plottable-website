    <h2>Let's Begin!</h2>
    <p>
      We've loaded in a data set of all the ships available in <strong><a
      href="http://www.eveonline.com/">EVE Online</a></strong>, and we'd like
      to explore it. First, to get a sense for what's in this high-dimensional
      data, let's make a histogram of the types of ships.

    <h2>Break it down</h2>
    <p>
      Ships in EVE are associated with the different races in the game. Lets
      see how the Frigates, Cruisers, Battleships, and Battlecruisers break
      down by race.

    <h2>More Dimensions</h2>
    <p>
      We've pretty much reached the limit of what bar charts can do for us.
      Now we want to plot even more dimensions at once! To accomplish this, we
      will add a number of styles to the scatter plot data-glyphs and leave
      the axes open for analysis on other dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glyph fill color represents its race, stroke is tech level, and
      radius is hull size.

    <h2>Use those axes</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we have the axes free for exploration, let's see how the ships'
      armor and shields compare across the race and hull types.
